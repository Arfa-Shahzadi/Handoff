# 🤖 Async AI Agent – Tool Calling Example

This project demonstrates how to build an **AI Agent** using asynchronous Python, tool-calling, and streamed responses.  
The agent decides **how many jokes to tell**, calls a tool, and streams the final output in real time.

## 📌 Features
- ⚡ Asynchronous execution using `asyncio`
- 🧠 AI Agent with custom instructions
- 🔧 Tool-calling support (e.g., `how_many_jokes`)
- 📤 Real-time streamed events (messages + tool output)
- 🗂️ Clean event handling via `Runner.run_streamed`
